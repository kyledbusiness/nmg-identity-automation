# NMG Identity Automation with Powershell

PowerShell tooling for identity lifecycle management, built for a fictional health enterprise named
Northstar Medical Group.

## The Problem

Northstar had no consistent and reliable way to identify user accounts belonging
to people who no longer worked there. The offboarding process was made up of a single employee who notified IT by email when someone left.
When she retired, the notifications stopped, and nobody noticed for over 100 days.

A manual search identified 23 stale accounts and took 11 hours
across 4 days. It could not identify accounts belonging to people whose
separation was never recorded, contractors who were never on payroll,
or service accounts that were never people at all.

## The Approach

Rather than comparing directory records against payroll records, these
tools search the domain controller directly for the last authentication
date of every single account. That value does not depend on paperwork being
filed correctly or names matching between systems.

## Tools

### Find-StaleAccounts.ps1

This tool identifies enabled accounts that have not authenticated within a given
number of days, including accounts that have never authenticated in the first place.
Exports a timestamped CSV along with a summary recording the exact query used.

    .\Find-StaleAccounts.ps1
    .\Find-StaleAccounts.ps1 -Days 30
    .\Find-StaleAccounts.ps1 -Days 180 -IncludeDisabled

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `-Days` | int | 90 | Days without authentication before an account is considered stale |
| `-ReportPath` | string | C:\Reports | Where reports are written |
| `-IncludeDisabled` | switch | off | Include disabled accounts in results |

**Output:** a timestamped CSV of findings, and a summary file recording
the question that produced them so the report can be reproduced.
